# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python

This is an analysis of the COVID-19 within Nigeria. It includes its effect on the economy and its distribution within the country.

# STEPS TAKEN

I downloaded and scraped the data from multiple sources including the NCDC.gov.ng and the world developmental index
I parsed the data into pandas dataframes
I cleaned and preprocessed the data
I explored the data by viewing a few of the records and checking the datatypes
I used data visualization and correlation analysis to read deeper insights

# SUGGESTIONS/ IMPROVEMENT PLANS

A live stream of the necessary data into a dashboard would make reading the state of the country with respect to COVID more convenient and instantaneous.
